DAILY PRACTICE AND CHALLENGE
=============================

This is only a daily practice and challenge for Ruby. Ruby is one of my favorite language after Python. All practices and challenges on Ruby is same with what I did when I do for Python as well.

## What idea that you have at this time?
To answer that, here is the idea list that I guess I want to try, before deep diving to Rails. You can find it on my challenge_coding directory, and if you interest, you can make by using your own prefer programming language or frameworks.

1. Money monitoring
	- Because I always spend a lot of money to buy the useless goods, even though, I AM A JOBLESS and currently searching for a job or projects, I wish I want to make a CLI app with Ruby that can help me to monitoring the money flow. 
	- To make it simple, first, I want to make a simple calculation, make a list of the use goods and useless goods, and, make the iterations what kind of useless goods that I should consider to avoid from buying.

2. Simple Todo App with CLI
	- Yeah, I know, a lot of newbies (or even professionals) always to think to make a Todo application, but I believe, if we make it a bit complicated, it would be fun.
	- This one I just figure out that I want to save the Todo's in my local files, where I can open, read, edit and delete.
	- Perhaps, ARGV? =p

3. Github CLI clones
	- Everytime I pushed my works on Github, I always figure out, how Github pushed the to our account.
	- From my knowledge and researched about Github, they used Ruby on Rals and here is why -> [Why was Github written in Ruby on Rails - Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-GitHub-written-in-Ruby-on-Rails)
	- It was not 100% similar to Github, but because Ruby have the built-in package, I am looking forward to try it

## Wow.. You are so ambitious man. Can you do it? Can you complete it?
Well, as a wise man, we don't know our ability but we, as a human, have to try and explore as much as we can.
